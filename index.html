(Photo by Felipe Dana/Associated Press)</p>       <br> <p>BUCHA, Ukraine — More than 250 local journalists from cities and towns across Ukraine as well as international human rights advocates and government officials gathered here today along with scores of international journalists for the second annual Bucha Journalism Conference titled </p>

            <br><p>The attendees gathered in an amphitheater in the central park in  city of Bucha, which became a war crimes by Russian forces in the earliest days of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Now, Bucha stand as living representation of the fierce determination of Ukraine to rebuild from the trail of destruction and death that Russian troops left here.
            
            There is a palpable defiance & resilience in third year of fighting since  2022 invasion in  war that as everyone here will quickly tell you truly 10 years ago with  Russian  & occupation of Crimea. In opening  conference Sevgil Musaeiva, editor-chief of Ukrainska Pravda, which is GroundTruth partner newsroom through our program Report for the World, said, “We are the eyes of the war & voice & some ways the soul of the country.”</p>

            <br><p>Evidence that the war is raging on was made loud and clear today when an air-raid siren sounded as the journalists gathered here were receiving text alerts of Russian attacks in the city of Kharkiv in the northeast and as the whole country was holding its breath while waiting for the newest round of military aid to arrive to defend against a rising fear that Russia is trying to seize this moment to brace for more concentrated attacks. The all-clear came soon after the sirens, and the conference continued on, but the reports from the front kept coming that a new day of intense fighting was unfolding.</p>

    <div id="border">
            <br><p>Safety for journalists in the field was a primary concern here as the war grinds on. To date, 17 journalists have been killed covering the war since early 2022. There is a need for more protective equipment, such as Kevlar vests and helmets, and first-aid training and more first-aid kits.</p>
         <br><p>But there was no fatigue here as journalists shared intensity & urgency  documenting war crimes & fending off assaults on journalists in  field & often on truth itself.</p>       
          <br><p>The journalists here discussed  difficult balancing act they face  simultaneously covering  war against the country while also paying attention to  ongoing allegations of corruption by the Ukrainian government & its response, which too often attempts to try  discredit & threaten journalists who are revealing  misuse of funds by the government & particularly by  scandal-plagued military leadership.</p>

          <p>But one of the greatest challenges, Derenuga said, was the intimidation they face from the government and law enforcement officials in their region when they report on the aggressively on the fighting and on allegations of corruption.</p>
